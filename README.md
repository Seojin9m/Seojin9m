Hi!👋

I'm Seojin (or Terry), a second-year Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I am currently interning as a Cloud Engineering Intern at CIBC. I'm highly interested in and passionate about backend and automation development! Feel free to reach out to me as I am always open to learn more about computer science 🙂
